Disney's Wonder Women

This is an original site built for my Junior Intensives; fall 2020.

This site will focus on some of Disney's most timeless female characters. The content on this web page will delve into some of Disney’s most renowned female characters and will aim to include each character's traits, what they stand for, and how they can be seen as role models to all girls/women everywhere.

I am really excited about building this project because it is personal for me. As a child, I was bullied in elementary school. But, I remember coming home to my television and my VHS player and I would put on 'The Little Mermaid'. Ariel, the protagonist in the film, taught me how to embrace being seen as an "outcast" and labeled as "different", and yet, making something out of it. Ariel was still able to see beauty and love in the world, regardless of what people thought about her. She still wanted to be “part of that world”. If a movie and character like that could be my guide and do wonders for me as a child AND as an adult, then I want to highlight what Disney has created to ensure that girls everywhere can stumble upon this site and relate to it in their own personal way. 

DC Comics has its own Wonder Woman. Well, Disney has its own wonder women too. I believe every Disney woman has a story to tell. And they should all be commended. This is what my site intends to do. :)
